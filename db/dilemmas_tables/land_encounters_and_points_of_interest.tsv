land_enc_dilemma_bandits_emp	false	The smell of gunpowder hangs vaguely in the air, and even though the road seems relatively empty, the soldiers feel they are being watched. As the vanguard advances, a suspicious call of birds is heard. Should we continue down this path?	Bandits!	faction	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		
land_enc_dilemma_bandits_wef	false	The army crosses a thick forest, dark and humid.

They say they heard whispers in the trees, and advise preparing for a possible ambush. Should we continue down this path?	Bandits!	faction	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		
land_enc_dilemma_bandits_nor	false	Horses and chariots can be heard in the distance. They seem to surround the long line of the army everywhere. Crazy screams and expletives in a guttural and basic language are heard although they are not presented directly in front of the army. They seem like followers of dark powers who want a toll on us to let us through. What should we do?	Bandits!	faction	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma
