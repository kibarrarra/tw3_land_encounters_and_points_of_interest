missions_localised_description_land_enc_mission_smithy_dark_elves_armour_of_living_death	The blacksmith has sent some strange armor to our quartermaster. It appears to breathe smoothly and when someone is close it begins to move and smell the person. He told us that to complete it, we will need to bathe him in the blood of many enemies. We should fulfill the blacksmith request during our journey lord, maybe it will end up being useful to us?	false
